<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Chief is a big outdoors guy. He likes to spend his days basking in the sun and rolling around in dirt. His favorite
  thing to do is go on walks where he can take in as many smells and possible and get his slobber on everyone.</p>
<p>Chief recently became a big brother and is tolerating his younger sister despite how persistent she is when nipping
  his butt. Every once in a while cheif will amuse her with a game of tug-o-war which id like to think he lets her win
  beacuse he is twice her size but I think his younger sister might just be better. </p>
<p>Chief is currrently recoving from getting a cancerous tumor removed from his belly. Lucky the cancer wasn't too
  agressive and they were able to remove the entire tunor without it spreading to this lungs. He's recovery has been
  slow with a couple complications but he will be alright and rolling in the dirt soon.</p>
<p> Thanks for hearing all about Chief!</p>
